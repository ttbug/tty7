#   dist/tty7-<version>-windows-<arch>.zip        portable (unzip anywhere)
#   dist/tty7-<version>-windows-<arch>-setup.exe  Inno Setup installer
#     (Program Files or per-user, Start Menu shortcut, "Apps" uninstall entry)
#
# Fonts are embedded via include_bytes! and the app icon is compiled into the
# executable as a resource (see build.rs). So the payload is tty7-app.exe plus a
# sibling completions\ dir (loaded at runtime — see terminal::signature), the
# bundled ConPTY pair (loaded by the DLL search path — see below) and the
# license/readme. Windows release artifacts are intentionally unsigned. The
# in-app updater verifies the published SHA-256 checksum and PE file version
# before and after waiting for the GUI to exit.
