//! The mobile gateway, as a child of the daemon.
//!
//! Phones reach the panes this daemon holds, so this daemon is what keeps
//! the gateway running: while `Config::mobile_access` is on, it runs one as a
//! child process, and stops it when the switch goes off. Every daemon does
//! this the same way, whoever started it.
//!
//! The gateway is a process of its own, never a thread in here. iroh and its
//! runtime stay out of the process holding every pane, and a gateway that
//! falls over takes no session with it. Which program runs it depends on the
//! daemon:
//!
//! - `tty7-app --daemon` runs itself, as `tty7-app --mobile-gateway`;
//! - the lean `tty7-server` runs a `tty7-gateway` beside it or on `PATH`.
//!   It links nothing of the gateway, and a machine without one says so in
//!   the status file rather than seeming to start forever.
//!
//! The child's stdin is a pipe from here, and the gateway exits when that
//! pipe closes. So however this process ends — stopped, or crashed — its
//! gateway ends with it. A handoff stops it explicitly before the exec
//! ([`stop_for_handoff`]): the new image would never reap a child it did not
//! start. The next daemon starts a fresh one from its own binary, and no
//! gateway from an older build is left running.
