//! Which sidebar group a tab belongs to, and who decided.
//!
//! "The sidebar groups tabs by repo automatically. Pin what you want to keep."
//! Everything here follows from that sentence. Groups above the divider are
//! *kept*: a [`PinnedGroup`] is stored with the workspace, has an id, an order
//! the user chose and a name they may change, and a tab in one only ever
//! leaves by hand. Everything below the divider is *derived*: an [`AutoKey`]
//! is worked out from the tab's cwd (or, for an SSH pane, from the host it is
//! on) every time the sidebar is drawn, so a tab that `cd`s into another
//! repository walks into another group on its own, and a group whose last tab
//! leaves simply stops existing. Nothing about an auto group is stored except
//! whether it is folded.
//!
//! A pinned group may name a folder. That is what lets a group be kept for a
//! project while its tabs come and go: a tab whose cwd *enters* the folder
//! joins it (see [`EntryWatch`]), and an empty folder group stays on screen
//! with a row to open a tab in it. A pinned group without a folder is a plain
//! label the user files tabs under by hand.
