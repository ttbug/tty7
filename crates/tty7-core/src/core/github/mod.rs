//! Read-only GitHub: which repository a working tree belongs to, whose token
//! to read it with, and the handful of REST calls the right panel's GitHub tab
//! makes.
//!
//! Framework-free like the rest of this crate. The HTTPS half ([`http`]) is
//! behind the `github` feature, which only the GUI turns on — the headless
//! server never talks to GitHub.
