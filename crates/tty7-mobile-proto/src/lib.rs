//! The wire protocol between the tty7 mobile app and the desktop gateway.
//!
//! The phone never speaks the daemon's own protocols. Those are private to one
//! machine — no auth beyond socket permissions, message kinds that can hand a
//! pane's process over or replace the server binary — and they change version
//! whenever the desktop grows a feature. The gateway (`tty7-gateway`) sits on
//! the desktop, speaks both, and exposes only this small vocabulary:
//!
//! - one iroh connection per phone, authenticated by the phone's endpoint key;
//! - one bidirectional QUIC stream per purpose, opened by the phone, whose first
//!   frame is an [`Open`] and whose first answer is an [`OpenReply`];
//! - a [`Open::Control`] stream carrying [`Tree`] snapshots of every
//!   workspace, tab, pane and agent status on the machine;
//! - a [`Open::Pane`] stream per terminal on screen: raw output down, raw
//!   keystrokes up, and a few [`PaneEvent`]s beside them;
//! - a one-shot [`Open::NewTab`] stream that starts a shell in a new tab and
//!   answers with a [`TabCreated`];
//! - a one-shot [`Open::ClosePane`] stream that closes a pane and ends what
//!   runs in it;
//! - a one-shot [`Open::Upload`] stream that carries a file from the phone to
//!   the machine and answers with where it landed, an [`Uploaded`];
//! - a one-shot [`Open::Diff`] stream that answers with a git working tree's
//!   changes, a [`Diff`].
//!
//! Every frame is `u32` little-endian length, a one-byte kind, then the
//! payload — the same shape as the daemon's frames, so there is one framing
//! rule across tty7. Kind [`KIND_JSON`] carries a JSON message; kind
//! [`KIND_BYTES`] carries terminal bytes verbatim (output downstream, input
//! upstream), which would triple in size as JSON.
