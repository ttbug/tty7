//! Getting around the editor: back and forward through where the caret has
//! been, Go to Symbol, and the breadcrumbs over the text.
//!
//! **History.** Every jump — Go to File, Go to Line, Go to Symbol, a file link
//! clicked in the grid, a definition a language server found, a click far down
//! the file — is noticed the same way: [`Tty7App::editor_nav_tick`] samples the
//! caret each time the editor draws, and a caret that changed file, or moved
//! [`JUMP_LINES`] or more without the text changing under it, has jumped. The
//! place it left goes on the back stack. Nothing has to remember to report a
//! jump, so a new way of jumping cannot forget to.
//!
//! One history per tab, like a tab's strip of files: each tab is its own
//! editor group. A place in a file that has since been closed opens the file
//! again; one in an untitled buffer that is gone is skipped.
