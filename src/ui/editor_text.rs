///   byte is below `0xA1`, so the zone test rejects it. The round-trip test
///   guarantees that choosing GB18030 never costs a byte on save.
/// - Windows-1252 is the fallback because it can decode every byte and encode
///   every result back, so a misjudged file is displayed wrongly but never
///   corrupted by an unchanged save.
///
/// Shift_JIS, EUC-KR and Big5 are deliberately not guessed. EUC-KR occupies

/// so telling them apart needs character-frequency models, not a range check.
