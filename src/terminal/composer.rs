//! The message composer: a real text box for writing a prompt to a coding
//! agent the way a chat box lets you — mouse selection, the platform's own
//! editing keys, an IME with its candidates in place, files attached as chips,
//! `/` and `@` menus — and handing it over whole.
//!
//! **Where it sits.** For an agent whose input area tty7 can find on the grid
//! (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini) the box is laid *over* that area: the agent's
//! own input line and the status rows under it are covered, so the pane has
//! one input rather than two. Whenever the agent puts something else there —
//! a permission prompt, a model picker, a question — the area stops looking
//! like an input, the box steps aside, and the keyboard goes to the TUI until
//! the input comes back. Any other agent gets the box docked under the grid,
//! taking its rows from it.
//!
//! **What it sends.** Sending is typing, not an API: the text and then Enter,
//! written to the pty — see [`submit_plan`] for why each agent is spoken to
//! slightly differently. The toolbar's controls are the agent's own keys
//! (Shift+Tab, its `/model` and `/effort` commands), and what they show is
//! what the agent said: the mode off the status row the box covers, the model
//! and context off what its hooks report ([`crate::core::cli_agent::AgentReadout`]). Nothing reported
//! means nothing shown.

///
/// - **The text and the Enter are separate writes**, [`SETTLE`] apart. In one
///   write, the CR is part of the text as far as the agent can tell.
/// - **A single plain line is typed**, not pasted: it goes in the way the
///   keyboard would have sent it, so the agent treats it like typing — a `/`
///   command opens its menu, nothing is folded into a "pasted text"
///   placeholder. Anything with a line break, a tab or other control
///   character, or past [`types_cleanly`]'s bound goes as one bracketed paste,
///   so the lines are the message's rather than a series of Enters.
/// - **Codex is always pasted.** It watches for bursts of fast keystrokes to
///   spot pastes from terminals that do not bracket them, and the Enter after
///   a typed burst is swallowed into it.
/// - **So is Gemini**, and Qwen Code and Qoder with it
///   ([`reads_like_gemini`]). It judges each key of a burst against the
///   input as it was before the burst, so every `?` in a typed line reads as
///   the key that
///   opens its shortcuts on an empty input and is lost, and every `!` as the
///   one that switches it into shell mode — "hi! there" would run `there`.
/// - **So are OpenCode and Amp.** OpenCode reads a typed burst the same way
///   Gemini does — the `!` in "PONG! ok" switches it into shell mode and the
///   line runs as a command — and Amp takes a typed leading `?` for the key
///   that opens its shortcuts, and a typed leading `/` for the one that opens
///   its command palette, with the rest of the burst landing in the input
///   under it and Enter running whatever the palette had on top.
/// - **So is Copilot.** A typed leading `?` is the key that opens its help,
///   and the rest of the line goes out without it. Its shell mode is a
///   leading `!` it reads off a paste as well.
/// - **So is Kimi Code.** It takes keys arriving faster than typing for an
///   unbracketed paste, and the Enter right behind a typed line for one of its
///   newlines: the message sat in its input, never sent. A bracketed paste it
///   knows for one, and reads its `!`, `?` and `/` off it as typed.
/// - **So is Prime Agent.** Its `@` list opens as a typed mention is
///   typed, stays open past the space after it, and takes the Enter: "read
///   @a.txt " went out as "read @a.txt .git/". A paste it reads whole, its
///   `!` and `/` included.
/// - **A leading `!` goes to Claude Code, CodeBuddy, Gemini, Qwen Code and
///   OpenCode on its own.** It
///   switches the input into shell mode only when it is typed into an empty
///   box as a key of its own; arriving with the rest of the line it is just a
///   character. (Amp's shell mode is a leading `$`, which it reads off a paste
///   as well.)
/// - **A message with an `@` mention gets a space after it for Gemini, Qwen
///   Code, Copilot, Oh My Pi and Grok Build.**
///   With the caret at the end of an `@` word it lists matching files, and
///   Enter then takes the list's pick instead of sending — so a message whose
///   attachments close it would sit in the input, under the box, unsent.
///
/// Without bracketed paste switched on, line breaks go as LF: to every agent
/// input that is Ctrl+J, a newline in the message, where a CR would send each
/// line as a message of its own.
