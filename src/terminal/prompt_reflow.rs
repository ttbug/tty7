//! Reflows a pane's grid without stranding the prompt the shell is about to
//! redraw (#654).
//!
//! A shell sitting at its prompt answers a `SIGWINCH` by redrawing the prompt
//! relative to where it left the cursor: zsh and bash move up as many rows as
//! the prompt's last line and the command being edited took at the width they
//! last drew at, return to column 0, and clear everything below. A column
//! change reflows the grid underneath that arithmetic. A prompt whose right
//! side sits near the edge — an `RPROMPT` clock, a right-aligned segment —
//! wraps onto a second row when the pane narrows by two columns or more, the
//! grid keeps the cursor on the row holding the wrapped tail, and the redraw
//! starts there: the head of the old prompt stays behind, still marked as
//! wrapping into the new one. Every such step of a window drag leaves another,
//! and a later widening joins them into one long line of prompt fragments
//! across the pane — the shell and the grid agreed on the width the whole time.
//!
//! So a reflow at a prompt hands the prompt back first, the way kitty does for
//! a shell with integration: the cursor's line, from its first row down, is
//! the shell's to repaint and is cleared, and after the reflow the cursor is
//! put back as many rows below that line's start as it was before — the count
//! the shell is about to move up by. A second reflow that lands before the
//! shell has redrawn (a drag outrunning the prompt) finds those rows blank and
//! unwrapped, so it leaves them where they are and the count still holds.
//!
//! Only the cursor's own line is handed back. A multi-line prompt's upper
//! lines end in a newline, not a wrap, so they reflow like any other output;
//! they are also the rows the shell redraws without being told where they are.
